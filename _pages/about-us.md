The National Sikh Museum in Derby is a very unique museum that celebrates the rich and diverse history of the Sikh community and it's contributions to society being the very first of its kind in the world! Museum was launched with a specific purpose in mind - to leave an everlasting legacy in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, the Sikh holy scriptures. Our story began over three decades ago when a group of young Sikhs embarked on a journey of discovery to learn more about their heritage. Inspired by their experiences, these young Sikhs sought to tell the British-Sikh version of their heritage in a modern setting. And thanks to the energy and commitment of the Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara in Derby, the first National Sikh Heritage Centre and Holocaust Museum was launched in November 2009.

Today, the core volunteer’s team behind the National Sikh Museum has a local and national presence, setting a precedence for others to follow. Our agenda is simple and unbiased - to conserve, preserve, interpret, promote, and inspire the special British-Sikh relationship like never before. We do this not for personal gain or political agendas, but to make a difference.
Our objectives are equally clear: to articulate the story of the Sikhs, beginning in the times of the Gurus through to modern times in a fresh, informative, and inspirational manner; to promote community cohesion, tolerance, and mutual understanding with the Anglo-Sikh experience and disappearing heritage of Punjab; to tell the Sikh Holocaust story with a view to highlighting the dangers of religious, cultural, ethnic, race, linguistic, national, and political intolerance; and to be the partner of first choice with key museums and libraries in the UK and overseas.

We also host a variety of events and exhibitions throughout the year to showcase the rich and diverse history of the Sikh community in Britain. Our museum is open to everyone, regardless of their background, and we welcome visitors from all over the world to come and explore our exhibits and learn more about the Sikh community in Britain. Come visit us to be enlightened and inspired!

Our achievements speak for themselves. We have pioneered ‘Voyages of Discovery which took young people on field trips to research UK places of Anglo-Sikh significance. This led to the publication of a resource book in 1994 which described UK connections with Anglo-Sikh history. We have also developed a well-received touring exhibition titled ‘Warm, Rich and Fearless’, which was hosted at Nottingham Castle, London, Birmingham, Leeds, and other UK locations.

In addition, we arranged the first Panthic viewing of the canons of Maharajah Ranjeet Singh at the 300th anniversary of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji in Loughborough. An estimated 50,000 Sangat (congregation) attended this Samagam (event) - the largest celebration outside of India. We have also created educational packs in line with the UK national curriculum, and we look forward to working with schools, colleges, and Universities as well as other institutions.

We are proud of what we have achieved so far, and we are committed to continuing our work to celebrate and promote the rich heritage of the Sikh community in Britain. We hope that you will join us on this journey of discovery and inspiration!
