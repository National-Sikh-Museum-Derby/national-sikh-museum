We aim to provide resources that can be used by teachers, students, and parents to learn more about Sikh history and culture. This could include lesson plans, activity sheets, and reading lists within our new and expanded Reference Library by Vaisakhi 2024.

We are further working on the below to be available in the near future:

•	Online exhibitions: Showcase virtual exhibitions that highlight the museum’s collections and the history of the Sikh community as Commonwealth.

•	Audio and video content: Include interviews, oral histories, and videos that offer a deeper understanding of Sikh culture and history.

•	Blog posts and articles: Publish regular blog posts and articles that explore different aspects of Sikh history, culture, and tradition.

•	Reference materials: Provide resources that can help researchers and academics delve deeper into Sikh history and culture, such as bibliographies and links to scholarly articles and research papers.

Here are some links to online resources for now:
