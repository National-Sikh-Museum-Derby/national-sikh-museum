The National Sikh Museum takes immense pride in fostering meaningful affiliations with esteemed organizations that share our commitment to preserving and promoting Sikh history and culture.

We are delighted to spotlight three distinguished affiliates, each contributing uniquely to our collective narrative: Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha Derby, Panjab Times and Akaal Primary School. Together, we stand as pillars of knowledge, united in our dedication to preserving the rich tapestry of Sikh history, Values and Ethos within the United Kingdom.

**Illuminating Sikh Narratives through Media Excellence**

In partnership with Panjab Times, we celebrate the power of media to amplify Sikh stories. Panjab Times, a distinguished media platform, lends its expertise to broadcasting and disseminating the diverse narratives that shape the Sikh experience in the UK. Together, we strive to provide a dynamic platform for the exploration of Sikh history and culture through the lens of contemporary media.

### [Akaal Primary School](https://www.nishkamschooltrust.org/aps/)

  **To be humble, to be wise**
  
The School began its story in 2015 with just 23 children in porta cabins on the car park of the Sri Singh Sabha Gurudwara. The new school building opened in 2018 where pupil numbers continue to increase. Today they have all-year groups from Reception to Year 6 classes, and enjoy excellent facilities on their stunning grounds!
