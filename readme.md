### Where is the first page
`index.html` that is at the root of the folder which is for the homepage. It uses the `default` layout from `_layouts\default.html`.
The other pages are in `_pages`. 

There is a `_include\posts.html` which I believe get hooked by jekyll from `_posts` automatically.

### What is `_includes/` folder
The _includes folder in Jekyll is a directory where you can store reusable HTML code snippets that can be included in your Jekyll pages and posts using the Liquid templating engine.
